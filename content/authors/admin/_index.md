I am a PhD student at the Center for Geospatial Analytics at North Carolina State University. I am currently working with remote sensing imagery to further explore surface water resources. More information on my background and education is available on my resume. Throughout my career I have focused on adding up knowledge on agriculture, water resources, climate, remote sensing and GIS. Below, there is a summary of my experiences and main projects.
